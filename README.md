Live Digital Clock
This project's goal is to create a digital clock that tells the the time from a laptop. As I am based in EST, the time showcases the EST time, with a correct "AM" or "PM" reading. 
I chose to do this project to refamiliarize myself wth JavaScript functions, as well as HTML and CSS syntax.
